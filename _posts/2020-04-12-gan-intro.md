### Introduction of Generative Adversarial Network(GAN)
üëâpart : 01
> ‚úç ‡¶¨‡¶ø‡¶∑‡¶Ø‡¶º : Generative Adversarial Network(GAN)


<h2> <b>  <center>Introduction</center>  </b> </h2>

<p>GANs are a hot topic of research today in the field of deep learning. Popularity has soared with this architecture style, with it's ability to produce generative models that are typically hard to learn. There are a number of advantages to using this architecture: it generalizes with limited data, conceives new scenes from small datasets, and makes simulated data
look more realistic.</p>


<p>The GAN compose of three different names such as Generative, Adversarial and Network. Generative means we will generate some probability distribution which becomes close to the original data that we want to approximate. Adversarial means conflict or opposition. So, there will be two networks which we call them discriminator and generator. So, these two neutral networks fight against each other in order to learn the probability distribution function. So adversarial comes because of this reason.</p>
<br>

## Two classes of models in machine learning:
______________________________

#### üëâ A. Generator model:
<p>A generator network uses existing data to generate new data. It can, for example, use existing images to generate new images. The generator's primary goal is to generate data (such as images, video, audio, or text) from a randomly generated vector of numbers, called a latent space. While creating a generator network, we need to specify the goal of the network. This might be image generation, text generation, audio generation, video generation, and
so on.<p>

#### üëâ B. Discriminative model:
<p> The discriminator network tries to differentiate between the real data and the data generated by the generator network. The discriminator network tries to put the incoming data into predefined categories. It can either perform multiclass classification or binary classification. Generally, in GANs binary classification is performed. </p>
